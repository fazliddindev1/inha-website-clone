### Goals:

- **Showcase Skills:** Demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a real-world project.
- **Learning and Growth:** Apply and expand my knowledge of front-end development by replicating a complex and well-designed website.
- **Portfolio Project:** Create a project that can be included in my portfolio to impress potential employers and collaborators.
